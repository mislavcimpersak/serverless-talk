					- Hello! I'm Mislav, web developer from Zagreb.
					- Primarily Python dev, but lately more and more dabbling with the ops side of my "full stack developer" title.
					- Serverless is something we're all talking about, but only a few actually had a chance to make something.
					- In the past few weeks I took some time to finally play with this fairly new technology so I decided to share with you my experience and experiments.

				<h2>Serverless</h2>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- What is "serverless"?
					- The term on it's own it's a bit apsurd, but it entered our regular IT vocabulary like many other nonsensical terms in IT jargon.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2 style="text-decoration: line-through;" class="fragment shrink" data-fragment-index="1">Serverless</h2>
				<h2 class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">FaaS</h2>
				<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Function-as-a-Service</p>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Serverless doesn't really mean that there are no servers, but that the developers don't have to worry about them.
					- So in essence, at least from the developers point of view, serverless really is without servers.
					- These days most developers aren't writing their code in assembly. Instead they are using modern programming languages that know on their own how to properly use CPU, memory, network resources, stored data.
					- Serverless takes this even one step further, apstracting another layer - infrastructure.

					- Developers build small blocks of code - functions - which are invoked when needed.
					- When a function is invoked, platform on which the function is stored starts resources needed for execution and returns result.
					- Such functions can be chained and interlinked to create complex applications.
					- Each function is then called if and when needed, depending of application logic.
					- Rest of the time, the function is not using any resources.

					- So, if we observe serverless from the point of simple functions we get to a better name, and that is Function-as-a-Service.

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- AWS's Lambda is the most famous Function-as-aservice provider.
					- Most of the blog posts you can find online talks about it.
					- But, as it expected, there are equivalent solutions on other cloud providers.

					- Microsoft has Azure Functions and Google has Google Cloud Functions.
					- Aproximately same set of programming languages are supported by AWS and Azure, while Google only supports JS.
					- All three provides allow same free tier of 1M monthly requests for all functions per account.

					- All providers are tightly integrated in their platforms. And thus acordingly the triggers that can run a function are regulary with the provider's ecosystem.
					- The obvious exception is HTTP traffic that is a common trigger for all of them.

				<h2>Advantages</h2>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Before I continue talking about advantages I must confess that I'm currently in a honeymoon phase with FaaS.
					- Everything is beautiful and dandy, and everything that is not so great I'm not seeing as such a bad thing.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Idea to launch</h2>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Time to launch is by far the biggest and most important benefit.
					- Let's say you have an idea and you wan't to show it to the world as soon as possible.
					- The usual steps for it are:
					- the idea itself, writing code, buying a server, installing OS, installing web server, installing WSGI server, setting up supervisor, setting up firewall, setting up backup, and 10 more tasks like that and only than launch.
					- And honestly, the only thing that is of any interest to you as a developer (especially for a side project) is idea, writing code and publishing your creation.
					- Anything else can be someone else's problem.
					- Which leads us to the second advantage:
					- Što nas vodi do druge prednosti:
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>No system administration</h2>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- In a completely serverless architecture there is no need for a sys admin.
					- There are no bash scripts, starting and stoping services and things like that.
					- Only thing that is necessary is writing the code, packaging it and uploading it to a FaaS platform.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Automatic scaling</h2>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- We don't have sys admins, but we do have scaling.
					- Once you have written your function, suddenly you have thousands of them at your disposal that are sleeping and just waiting to complete a task you provide them and all that withing microseconds from activation.
					----
					- Of course, scaling works both ways.
					- Why pay for servers when you are not using them.
					- You only pay for executions, not the server's idle time.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Parallelization</h2>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Parallelization is linked to automatic scaling, but it's still different.
					- Not only that you have at your disposal hundreads of functions that are waiting for your task, but you have hundreads functions that can do the same task at the same time.
					- example:
					- Let's say that we have a document store database in which we are writting articles.
					- And now we want to add or remove some data on all articles.
					- The usual way to be to write a script that would go through all articles one by one and edit them.
					- We have 50.000 articles and it takes 1 second to edit an article. That's a bit less than 14 hours for 50.000 articles.
					- If we take into consideration that the current limit on AWS's Lambda is 1000 concurrent executions, with the help of a bit smarter script we can start 1000 Lambda functions and get all the work done under a minute.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Change in mindset</h2>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- "Change in mindset" is a bit less tangible advantage, but quite important for today's applications.
					- FaaS incourages creating small parts, loosely conected.
					- Unix philosophy and Unix way of thinking - problems are easier to solve if they are broken into smaller pieces.
					- FaaS as such perfectly fits and encourages microservices architecture.

			<section data-background-image="media/dried_mud.jpg">
				<h2>Disadvantages</h2>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Of course, not everyting is so great.
					- There are flaws.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Vendor lock in</h2>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Unfortunately all the top vendors have their own closed and specific solely to them implementation.
					- There are in some projects attempts to create abstractions layers that should combat this problem and make it possible to run the code on any provider.
					- But, for now it's all more in the "attempt phase", than a proper out-of-the-box solution.

				<h2>Cold start</h2>

				<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">
					<a href="https://read.acloud.guru/does-coding-language-memory-or-package-size-affect-cold-starts-of-aws-lambda-a15e26d12c76">*thorough analysis</a>
				</p>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Under advantages I've said that functions when not used are "turned off" what is a good thing.
					- Bad thing is that for the initial start it takes a bit more time.
					- AWS kill functions after more than 5 minutes of inactivity. Sometimes that's half an hour and sometimes 5 minutes and 2 secs. Why does it kill them exactly when it kills them, only Amazon knows.
					- We as Python developers are in luck, because when it comes to Python it is still only a few seconds max, while Java and C# developers need to prepare them self for more than 100 times lower starting times.
					- I gave here an URL to a blogpost in which a developer does a really extensive comparison, it's interesting to have a look if for nothing more than to see how nice it is to be a Python developer.
					- Increasing memory available to function lowers down cold start time.
					- But surprisingly, package size has no effect on cold start.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Maturity</h2>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Serverless as an idea exist only for the past 3 years.
					- Thigs are still chaning, often in the background without any explanation from vendors.
					- New functionalitis are slowly introduced (Google still only supports only JS, AWS Lambda can't be triggered from Simple Queue Service events...)
					- Debugging is problematic, it's often try-and-error based.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/helicopters_deployment.jpg">
				<h2>Deployment</h2>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Honestly, everything can be done by hand, through AWS management console, but just don't.
					- You are just making it more difficult for your self.
					- If you've deleted a function, you've also delete all of the functions configurations.
					- But if you are using any toolkit you can have all the configs in version control so you can easily redeploy.
					- Also, setting up AWS's API gateway never brought a smile to anyones face.

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- For start we have AWS's command line interface
					- Not a big upgrade from manual configurations, especially when you see the lenghty piece of command you need for initial deployment.

					- Because of this complex procedure three tools were developed that take out the guess work out of deployment and update.
					- Serverles is a toolkit for setting up serverless architecture.
					- It is being developed as a tool for JS, Python, Java and C#.
					- Project developers are trying to be platform agnostic, but unfortunately that is still impossible because of the providers them self.

					- Chalice was created by AWS and is advertised as "Python Serverless Microframework".
					- Similar to Flask it uses decorators for declaring routes.
					- It's completely oriented on serverless and minimalism and provides the most straight forward cli to Lambda.
					- Recommendation if you plan to do something brutally simple with max one or two API points with minimum logic.
					- All in all, a solid tool.

					- Zappa was created as an idea to enable deployment of WSGI apps to Lambda.
					- Think about likes like Django, Flask, Bottle, Falcon, Hug, new APIStar etc.
					- Zappa sets up API gateway on it's own, so that when an http request arrives, Gateway starts the function.
					- Function than takes the request and processes it.
					- When the function is done, response is being set back through API gateway all the way to the client.

					- A common thing for all three tools is simplicity.
					- So just choose a tool that makes most sense for your needs.

					- Btw. when you hit `deploy` or `update` is the moment in which you start to understand the snail speed of local ISPs.
					- Good thing is that the deployment is not making the funciton to be unavailable, but when a new instance is started it is started with the new code.

					- I preferrer Zappa, so that's the one I chose for the next couple of examples.

				<h2>Examples</h2>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- When I first started writing this talk I was pondering what kind of example should I present.
					- I wanted to show something that is interesting enough, but still not too complicated to make my life miserable.
					- And I remembered a joke I had few months ago with my friends.
					- An idea that was put on ice just because I didn't feel like paying hosting and setting up server just for it.
					- Honestly, only thing I did feel like doing was writing 20-30 lines of code and release my joke in to the wild.

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- First iteration was fairly simple.
					- I wrote about 30 lines of code that could be sum up to a call to my custom method for posting a tweet.
					- I created a basic `zappa_settings.json` file.
					- It's enough to have only one `aws_region`, but it could be deployed globaly, but it doesn't make much sense for a project like this.
					- `secrets.py` is a "flat" json file in which I wrote all credentials and it's hosted on an S3 bucket.
					- That way I could open source my code.

					- Since this is a function that doesn't have to be available over HTTP, I disabled API Gateway.
					- And in the end I deployed to Lambda.
					- Zappa has a special command that can be used to call any function or code on Lambda for easy testing.
					- And everything worked perfectly.

					- And than the problems started.
					- The biggest was that the tweet had to be sent every day at noon.
					- In Croatia.
					- AWS servers are on UTC time, and well, Croatia is not.
					- Setting up time zone aware scheduler which takes into account daylight saving hours is apsurd.
					- Debugging is a hit and miss.
					- Zappa created unnecessarily large .zip files. Why? No idea.
					- It goes though site-packages dir and just adds everything, from pep8 package, pytest, coverage, jupyter,... everything.
					- The solution is to write a really long list of excludes.
					- And than again try-and-error to see if the function is still working.

					- It taks a bit of fooling around to serve images directly.
					- Probably it can still be optimized, but since it was setup up in less than an hour, I'm happy.
					- Unfortunately, IOpipe which was excellent for monitoring non-WSGI functions isn't working for WSGI apps.
					- The development of the official python plugin is currently on break.
					- I've tried to add somethings to it, but still no response on the official Github repo.
